# Password cracker 

Developed during October, 2019.

## Description

A simple command-line interface for cracking passwords. It is setup to crack salted SHA256  passwords with dictionary and hybrid attacks, but can be modified with minimal effort. One can easily change the hashfunction, the salt position, and write new attacks.

## Running

Built with Python 3.7.2 using

```
argparse
hashlib
tqdm
```

In `/scripts` use `python3 main.py <attacktype> <hashfile> <wordfile>`. <br/>

- `attacktype` <br/>
The attack type used. Choices: `d: dictionary`, `h:hybrid`.
- `hashfile` <br/>
The name of the .txt file containing the salts and the hexadecimal representation of the hashes, e.g.,  `35501f52a4652dea:8071430e01f99174e749b5787328f900ce6343c330ba607ebb4fbc5c8b15a559`, on each line.
- `wordfile` <br/>
The name of the .txt file containing the password guesses on each line.
